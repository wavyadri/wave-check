# WAVE CHECK

This year while working remote I also had the opportunity to learn how to surf!

I surfed a few spots and kept in touch with surfers I met along the way. We wanted to keep each other updated on how surf conditions were as we changed locations and have a little friendly comparision to see who was catching the biggest waves.

Instead of looking up the individual surf reports from an existing forecast website, I built a tool that fetched live data and compared two surf reports at once. 

## TOOLS
- React
- TypeScript
- Axios
- Chart.js
- Google Places API
- Geocoding
